        "title": "Spence vs Ugas HIGHLIGHTS: April 16, 2022 | PBC on Showtime PPV",
        "description": "(April 16, 2022) Errol Spence Jr. navigated treacherous waters on Saturday night to pick up a third welterweight title. The IBF and WBC welterweight champion showed his greatness against WBA champion Yordenis Ug\u00e1s, battling back from early adversity to stop Ug\u00e1s in the tenth round.\n \nThe remaining welterweight title not in Spence\u2019s possession belongs to WBO titleholder Terence Crawford, who was an interested observer on Saturday, Tweeting his reaction to the Spence victory. Spence made clear his preference for his next opponent.  \n \n\u201cEverybody knows who I want next,\u201d Spence said. \u201cI want Terence Crawford. That\u2019s the fight that I want. That\u2019s the fight everybody else wants. Like I said, I\u2019m going to get these straps then go over there and take his too. Terence I\u2019m coming for that belt!\u201d\n \nSpence had to overcome some harsh conditions courtesy of Ug\u00e1s to get to this point. After Ug\u00e1s hurt Spence in the sixth, knocking his mouthpiece out with an uppercut, Spence of DeSoto, Texas, stormed back to hurt Ug\u00e1s repeatedly to the body and eye. By the tenth round, Ug\u00e1s\u2019 right eye was completely shut when referee Laurence Cole stopped the contest for the second time to allow the ringside physician to inspect the damage.\n \nUnlike earlier, the doctor advised Cole to stop the bout at 1:44 of the tenth round, giving Spence (28-0, 22 KOs) a resounding victory, a third welterweight belt, and perhaps the greatest triumph of his still accumulating career following a 17-month layoff after corrective surgery to his left eye forced him to pull out of a mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao.  \n \n\u201cI feel sad,\u201d Ug\u00e1s said. \u201cI trained really hard for this fight. All my respect to Errol Spence. He\u2019s a great champion. I\u2019m just sad about what happened tonight. The referee stopped the fight, but I wanted to keep going to the end. I definitely had a chance to win the fight in the sixth round, but he recuperated well. Congratulations to him and his team.\u201d\n\n#ErrolSpenceJr #YordenisUgas #SpenceUgas\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

          "description": "(April 16, 2022) Errol Spence Jr. navigated treacherous waters on Saturday night to pick up a third welterweight title. The IBF and WBC welterweight champion showed his greatness against WBA champion Yordenis Ug\u00e1s, battling back from early adversity to stop Ug\u00e1s in the tenth round.\n \nThe remaining welterweight title not in Spence\u2019s possession belongs to WBO titleholder Terence Crawford, who was an interested observer on Saturday, Tweeting his reaction to the Spence victory. Spence made clear his preference for his next opponent.  \n \n\u201cEverybody knows who I want next,\u201d Spence said. \u201cI want Terence Crawford. That\u2019s the fight that I want. That\u2019s the fight everybody else wants. Like I said, I\u2019m going to get these straps then go over there and take his too. Terence I\u2019m coming for that belt!\u201d\n \nSpence had to overcome some harsh conditions courtesy of Ug\u00e1s to get to this point. After Ug\u00e1s hurt Spence in the sixth, knocking his mouthpiece out with an uppercut, Spence of DeSoto, Texas, stormed back to hurt Ug\u00e1s repeatedly to the body and eye. By the tenth round, Ug\u00e1s\u2019 right eye was completely shut when referee Laurence Cole stopped the contest for the second time to allow the ringside physician to inspect the damage.\n \nUnlike earlier, the doctor advised Cole to stop the bout at 1:44 of the tenth round, giving Spence (28-0, 22 KOs) a resounding victory, a third welterweight belt, and perhaps the greatest triumph of his still accumulating career following a 17-month layoff after corrective surgery to his left eye forced him to pull out of a mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao.  \n \n\u201cI feel sad,\u201d Ug\u00e1s said. \u201cI trained really hard for this fight. All my respect to Errol Spence. He\u2019s a great champion. I\u2019m just sad about what happened tonight. The referee stopped the fight, but I wanted to keep going to the end. I definitely had a chance to win the fight in the sixth round, but he recuperated well. Congratulations to him and his team.\u201d\n\n#ErrolSpenceJr #YordenisUgas #SpenceUgas\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"
