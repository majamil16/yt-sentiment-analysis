Not To Scream: IRL","[Music] did you just scream because if you did you would have lost today's challenge that's because today we're going to be playing try not to scream in real life with my girlfriend hey my friend's girlfriend all right how you guys feeling terrified we're gonna start this bit off really strong cause i've got a professional archer coming out right here so he's gonna shoot an apple off my head right now we're gonna see how this goes three two one help help help help help help help help nice guys please just just breathe slow right now or you can use my jacket yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a joke i'm fine get it what the heck you're a psychopath it's just a magnet i thought i just got shot with error you didn't scream nobody dude i'm in shock well boys we're going to do better than that i think yeah okay blindfolds back on let's get them out of here now each of our girlfriends have three strikes meaning if they scream three times throughout the rest of the day they're eliminated it's also worth mentioning that whoever wins this competition will be allowed to go on a free vacation to anywhere in the world so on the way to level two i had the boys find out where they'd want to go ladies how are we doing little scarred i'm unwell oh why didn't you scream your boyfriend was shot by an arrow i was in shock i would be surprised if all of them didn't scream on the next level avery yeah if you were to win this competition where are we going to go on vacation there's nothing going to be stopping me from going to paris let's go i want to go to greece where are you going to take us on our dream vacation we're going to italy the pizza maybe some honey a little bunch that's enough of that all right hope it doesn't have to be anywhere crazy just like a cozy cabin i think it's more about the quality time together with eric he's done youtube two out of the almost four years we've been together i think it'd just be nice to spend more time together you know that made me like you a percentage more oh that made me like you about two or three percent less you're gonna really hate it when i win maybe me and you fight and see who wins how about that it's on ladies i wish you the best of luck except you hope i don't care sick level two includes an art exhibit a mannequin gallery and a mystery box and as you could expect there's something off about this art and while i walk these girls through this exhibit we've named art attack the boys will be watching in the other room i never have faith in myself with challenges like this because i've brutally failed every single one you guys have put me in i think sam can redeem me iman how do you feel about caden i barely know her so you know all of us have been with our girlfriends for two plus years at least yeah but you've been here with your girlfriend about two and a half minutes oh here they come here oh here come the girls welcome to art attack it's a good thing this isn't a try not to laugh challenge miss avery did she just scream yeah that counts god dude you guys can go ahead and take your blindfolds off this right here is what i call fruits of labor all of these are painted with scented paint so i want you guys to really get close to these one of the paintings in this room someone's gonna bust their face through the painting and they're gonna have an earth-shattering scream this is the fruit of power it's all bow to the fruit of power bow through the power fruit of power what is happening i feel like eric can be a cult leader this is the fruit of despair it's a great representation of me yeah you kind of kind of have an oval shape well it's more like the despair part come on in here guys and if you guys look really close look really close dude i'm freaking out a little bit guys there's nothing there this is uh the being of rage looks like mac that does look like max i don't want you guys to feel any rage take a deep breath in and out i do have one more exhibit to show you i've got the cremated ashes of somebody very very special very important i'm going to bring you this way alakazam oh my god these ashes at the end of the hallway here these are the ashes of alexander the great you just peed alexander the great was actually poison that that's the end of level two let's go baby that's three screams only one level we're just scratching the surface it's fear it's true the levels only get more intense from here hey but you know how bad we need this trip to paris you signed me up for the one challenge that i you know is gonna be the hardest for me to do how did you feel about that level i thought i made it through the jump scare into the last one and then when that uh ash has exploded all over here there's nothing you can do sam you're doing great keep it up we're gonna go anywhere you want to go are you scared for level three no i'm very confident these girls are birds last and least we have hope over here what scares you the things that scare me are sharks and snakes you're afraid of sharks and snakes yeah that's what you said just write that down there no reason writing that down is there any like particular reason why you think you and eric deserve this because he works so hard as you guys see i literally hope that you lose magic all right girls you got to put your blindfolds back on we're pulling up to the next challenge my heart rate right now i can feel it sam you got this you need a vacation girls welcome to level three you've made it so far i'm joking you've not made it very far at all blindfolds off looks like a pretty plain room good thing i have my friend jay jay come on in here jay i asked jay to bring the most aggressive snakes you could find this right here is a bite from a snake i'm gonna set these ones on the floor we're gonna be kind of careful okay where'd they go oh my god don't move don't move so mac has night vision goggles on there's a bunch of props to mess with the girls and try to get them to scream so i was in this room earlier i'm telling you guys it is pitch black they legitimately can't see anything this is a frame of what the room looks like oh he's going in really cute i am going to kill eric oh my god oh oh i think they got her i think he got her oh is that a water gun my god [Music] [Music] i'm gonna kill you oh no i mean she just knew this is coming for fun at this point oh here we go here we go what is this gonna do oh he's scaring his own girlfriend he's flirting look at home frozen she's about to cry oh no oh it's a snake it's a snake oh what the hell oh she's she's swinging hey this is unfair i saw this on the internet so we brought the actual guy in oh yeah this is the thing what the heck is that that's a live b they're so scared i would be too all right let's turn the lights on welcome level three congratulations you guys were so good at this like i don't think you understand how much this just infuriated him that was not enough screaming okay listen buddy that was not fair you just shook your girlfriend's hand and scored everybody else's water guns i'm slightly biased hope you lost big time really yeah you're done you screamed like four times congratulations girls bye so they're celebrating over there but i'm gonna bring them into this break room which is actually not a break room at all this break room is actually part of the challenge and there's hidden cameras everywhere even in the fridge let's ride baby let's ride okay they're in the other room so we're gonna stay really quiet the girls are walking in now like they think they're on break right now so oh my god so on my text i can make that table explode you guys just tell me when you want to do it let's give sam her first strike i think we don't do that the same i think maybe we'll do that to like shut up i don't think this is a relaxed room i think i think oh no not kaden come on come on come on go go go go stay away my gosh well none of them sound familiar you know i'm just gonna take something now bro these girls are so strong avery is one strike away from losing it all right now i still have confidence what's her motivation right now why is she fighting to win this because we see each other four times a year we have a long distance relationship it's real yeah it's very real where do you guys think you're going to go if you win we want to go to paris why do you want to go to greece with caden it's the most expensive ah that's what i was looking for you guys are always all trying to drain my all of us are only here for money we're on payroll to be your friend so i've got a little surprise hidden in the fridge i'm hoping somebody goes forward your girl screamed your nose hey she tried her best you seem so calm all day are you actually calm no i'm shaking ladies welcome to the final two oh all right whatever tyler our least two favorite people are gone now now my least favorite version of the competition is your girlfriend i have to say the same about sam do you both have like a hatred towards each other right now no why i just can't wait for the pictures that i send you when we're in paris together oh he could photoshop that up real easy for sure because you're not actually going there we're going to be eating croissants on the eiffel tower on a real note are you nervous about losing what could potentially be the best vacation of all time for absolutely free i'm more worried about disappointing you than losing the vacation babe you could never disappoint me uh as long as you don't scream the final level is sudden death either of you fail this next challenge you're out how do they switch up the rules like this because you guys are too good at this stupid game or at the final level that's how are we feeling i'm ready to go to where italy i hope that you have some trick up your sleeve plan i always have a trick up my sleeve welcome to the petting zoo to maximize screen potential i decided to calm the girls down with now let's open the curtains puppies [Music] then three two one open the curtains a pony you guys keep thinking i'm gonna do something horrible but what would come next wouldn't be so cute as you guys can see here mac and tyler are duct taping their girlfriends to the ground looks like she's in prison you might notice a little hole down here kind of looks like a mouse hole like a rat hole might end up looking like a new york subway station in there oh my god i can't stop shaking oh look at that sam's scared tyler this is the first time i've seen her scared all day while we're waiting for mac and tyler i wanted to share this with you i am throwing the world's largest pizza party at the end of the year wait how you see when i was five i had a pizza party no one showed up so i decided when i hit 10 million subscribers i'm gonna invite 10 million of my closest friends you guys one subscribe equals one slice of pizza at the world's largest pizza party i'm not joking you're gonna be there tyler's gonna be there mac's gonna be there there they are now actually all right well we love you well we love you avery are you okay yeah if at any point you wanna quit you can just say beans so each of these bits has been crafted for each of the girls my girlfriend horrified of snakes avery is extremely claustrophobic and sam is deathly afraid of rats which brings me to our final level [Music] there's so many of them this is crazy oh they're on average sam has transcended to a different dimension get out there miss trainer yes would you mind helping uh push these rats and maybe set them on top of these young ladies their faces yeah maybe their faces this is not ending until somebody screams loudly oh sam is like on the verge of crying and tyler and sam decided not to go to italy they just went to the beach and sent me these videos they said they were too busy so i want every single one of you guys to comment tyler you silly buffoon yeah just comment that below and let me know where you guys want to go on vacation maybe i'll bring one of you guys on the next try not to challenge all right that's it video's [Music] over i"

Testing the Twin Turbo Hellcat","all right man today we have an objective bad as a truck boys look at it all right guys before we got to go racing today we got something we need to do because buddy of mine got his truck stuck in a goalie it rained here in kansas the goalie filled up with water and now his truck is in seven feet of water completely submerged so we're gonna go rescue it i'm sorry to tell you this have you heard about your car's extended warranty oh you have it well i'm gonna need to borrow this so i can go pull something out so sorry about your home get out of my truck mice sorry about this i need to take this now yeah i'm sorry you haven't paid your rent things are getting hard times not my fault i'm sure if it'll crank over yet but just in case it does he's ready to go [Laughter] we got it stuck and blew an airline look this side just been dragging that's why you can't go look nice that's why i don't go you know i think at this point let's just make an executive decision to just go try to rescue what we need to rescue without this if we need to we'll come back and get it all right men today we have an objective something we need to accomplish something we need to do we have to liberate this truck and we will we have behind us the best machinery that money could buy we have a ford bronco off facebook marketplace a can-am that's got a broken axle and one japanese skid loader with a winch we just welded to it with all that being said boys let's embark on our mission e-brake is set she's dug in hopefully that's enough to keep her from sliding so uh this is the draw that he got stuck in right when he got stuck there was no water in it can any of you guys find the truck look at that white thing white out there in the water are you serious so anyways uh who brought the scuba gear dude you know if you gotta use these to recover a vehicle you got stuck you are getting serious oh oh it's cold oh no my boots are filled with water how is this so true look up here floaty [Music] oh my god oh here's how you do it just get it over with nope let's go [Music] dude it's so cold hey that's about as much you got on the winch no way how far are we with from the truck where's it at oh i found it yeah i found it i bought it it's not that far under we're good i found it it's so weird i'm sitting on top of a truck right now in the middle of a pond that's cheating i didn't have a floaty i had to swim out here by myself hello tire how are you okay we got the tow rope well okay guys you want to see what a gmc looks like underwater what'd it look like i have all the slack from right here oh dude we don't got much but we got a little hook the nose hook to the wheel i'm thinking the wheel because i don't think i'll be able to reach the nozzle if it was under mud oh look at all the oil coming up i'm not sure if the gopro could see all that or not yeah no oil spill to be seen here goodbye epa i just got to make sure i don't lose a hook god damn it stupid truck who the hell that was a good idea to drive a truck in a pond hey can we hook it onto the running board no i can find that [Music] i figured out what's wrong the spokes on the wheel are too small to put the chuck in i mean just hold that i'm gonna go down there and see if i can feel for a place all right [Music] i found a big spoke on the tire so i can feel the bottom of the cab is this far from the mud and then the tire is completely kicked to my that's why i'm having a hard time hook onto it we're good we got it okay give her a tug is it moving it's moving [Music] i can't tell keep going it's moving it's moving no it's moving look it's it's tilted way more than it was oh no it's coming out of the water oh dude we can actually see the roof of it now hell yeah you guys are all screwed up oh we found it we found a truck i got it dude we're digging it in it's digging into the mud and he's still coming closer no we'll just keep going hey see if you can snatch walk off one of these trees or something to the left because we need to pull it this way excited for the seriousness of this situation this is really a nice swim oh damn geez come on keep going winter winter like we found as a truck boys look at it oh my god look at it you can see all the water inside of it you see the water line maybe you guys can see it i'm gonna take it out and hook it on this side there's

are you bury your truck deep better hooks on it oh well no wonder it's a junker oh there she goes she's starting to go dude that harbor freight winch is working great ain't it the tires strained out on their own this truck just wants to come out of the water guys this is a gmc three quarter ton for sale it's not on sale i know what i have this thing is a good truck one owner low mile sunday

don't let me down oh oh my god lj oh my god yes dude i missed that whole thing if she spun two times and i leaned back in it she got squirreling and i ran that dude oh my god it ran good i think we ran i don't know i think i i looked down at the boost gauge for a second we had 25 pounds of boost so i think that's fine but dude the power on this car how'd that go how'd that go really good um they are asking you to put a helmet on though because everything under like 1299 will ask but yeah what did it run i don't have a helmet with me okay they have them in the tower okay i might have to go steal one from him [Music] she was getting after it 10.05 in the quarter god damn she was fast that was all the soft launch that was a soft launch and it's fun i was just pedaling it down through there we gotta drop air pressure in the back we can go faster i got a helmet it's orange drag strip closed in 15 minutes yeah we got 15 minutes to run a nine second pass let's hopefully this will work is it running i can't hear is it smoking a lot yeah no the pump's still spinning the scavenge pump's still pumping hold on where's the line right here it's pumping oil must be an o-ring on the turbo's bad we don't even care we're still gonna go do it she's still got oil in there she's got oil pressure she'll be fine oh yeah there she goes all right second gear let's do this [Music] oh damn she got after baby i don't know what that was i don't know if it was faster or not but it felt faster oh dude i just want to pull up here and they tell me that i run like seven second quarter mile that's not going to happen but i want it how'd it do oh no you told me good job which 10-1 at 135 dang it she just needs a better tire i just can't keep down on it because the thing is as soon as i get down on it it just gets squirrely and gets away from me oh we don't have enough time and the car is hot now and it continues to spin so we failed we didn't run a 9 like we wanted to but that means we can come back next time and do better with better tires better wheels than more ice we was successful at one point the car is not broken but we'll be back next time to run a nine you"

what i bought for our trip to legoland this weekend yo that's so cool wait how'd you even convince your mom to go i thought you were grounded i just told her i would have failed any test this month but what she doesn't know is i don't have any tests i am such a [Music] it could be genius least to wash your hand first what are you scared of gene dude watch out you almost pulled the fire alarm morning boys good morning hey what you got there mr wilson what do you mean this this is a surprise that doesn't sound good not at all you've got to be kidding me he's going to give us a pop quiz yeah probably i got to find somewhere to get out of it come on the reading last night was easy it was yeah didn't you do it and miss out on my huge minecraft tournament no way i gotta get out of this test somehow um here we go again [Music] i can pretend i'm sick you already did that like five times and it never works true maybe i could pretend like i broke my leg by slipping in this hallway look at you well it's pretty hard to pretend that you broke a bone jay when you broke your arm was it all hunky-dory yeah dude that won't work besides they're installing cameras now so it'll be obvious you're faking it good morning hey good morning so when do you think you'll have it working i'm having a problem with the server they're not connecting uh hopefully by tomorrow great thank you so much today's my lucky day mikey we have to tell you every single time running away from problems just makes them worse please eric i've been running away from my problems since first grade look where it's gotten me uh where yeah you've been suspended at least five times you have been grounded every single summer and what's your gpa again i don't want to talk about that but i'm still the coolest kid in school yeah right all right look i'm going out of time all right come on mikey face it there's nothing you can do at this point don't underestimate me all right oh my god suck i'll figure something out okay do not turn these over just yet hey mikey no snacks in class put that away please hey you're supposed to use a cracker not your finger all right everybody what i have for you here is going to just have to wait one second uh keep him down please i'll be right with you did you hear what happened at chesterfield high some punk pulled the fire alarm they had to evacuate the whole school i hope they got the guy that did it last i heard they haven't figured out who it was i got it got what i'm gonna put a fire line what that's a terrible idea you're gonna get caught on camera but he said the camera won't be working till tomorrow oh they're gone i think that's going a little too far mikey what do they test for fingerprints then i'll pull it with my shirt that way there's no fingerprints i'm pretty sure mikey that pulling a fire alarm is an actual crime there could be very serious consequences if i got caught which will never happen do i have to explain it to you every single time your plans never work jinx i said it fox of course they do i'll prove it mr wilson can i use the bathroom real quick please yeah okay mikey uh just hurry back thank you [Music] excuse me thank you [Music] hey y'all young man help with something nope just go into the bathroom well you're going in the wrong direction bathroom is that a way oh yes i know i'm just getting something from my locker okay well when you do go be very careful of the wet floor okay yes sir one of the toilets overflowed [Music] [Music] [Music] remember what we practiced during the fire drill okay [Music] all the other students and teachers evacuated on the west side hopefully we'll get an update soon what's up kids well aren't you glad i got us out of that pop quiz can't believe you actually did that oh and to add on i also didn't get caught yeah not yet we'll see about that mikey there you are i was just inside looking for you how long have you been out here well i've been here since we evacuated you didn't notice no anyway uh i just spoke with principal danvers it sounds like we're gonna be out here for a little while longer dang it i was looking forward to that pop quiz pop quiz can i speak to you for a moment yes of course principal danvers what do you think you're talking about the better question is what rides are we going on when we get to legoland maybe i was thinking about that there's more to life than just skipping tests and going to amusement parks no there isn't mikey he's right you can't just expect to always get away without being caught as my dad always says running away from your problems just makes them worse well my dad says that the moon is made of cheese what's your point his point is is to stop pulling more pranks or else you won't be able to come to legoland with us yeah your mom might even take away your talent again you know what instead of being grateful you guys are making me feel bad for what i do all right well we're just waiting for the fire department to finish their rounds and make sure that everybody's safe the fire department's here yeah yeah they respond to every fire alarm right well wilson this is captain stoll he's going to be asking everybody some questions today it's nice to meet you nice to meet you all right so looks like it was a false alarm it's not the first time this has happened today so i need to gather some more info what were you in your class doing right before the alarm went off uh well i had just handed everybody some paperwork a teacher came in told me about what happened at chesterfield and then that's about all i can remember well thank you very much mr wilson of course yeah thank you [Music] hey you know what i actually did give mikey the key to the bathroom you did yeah mikey did you see anything no actually um you know i heard someone running down the hall before the fire alarm went off but that's all i remember all right well captain stole could you show us what you found so far of course follow me thank you mikey me why because you said you were the last one in the hall right so maybe you could provide some insight to us let's go okay none of that i'll be right back [Music] john anybody yes uh actually i was able to get the camera started right when the fire alarm went off wait you were yeah yeah i was gonna need more time but i figured it out uh here we go [Music] ah it looks like the camera started right after everyone started walking away you [ __ ] me i mean phew luckily everyone's okay mikey think what else was happening in the hallway when you were here let me retrace myself so i left mr wilson's classroom then i went to the bathroom everybody does anybody know what happened yet not yet mikey is explaining what was happening he went to the bathroom that's odd i was in there fixing the toilet when the alarm went off i didn't see you well um that's because i ran into the girls room you did what well you see george told me that the um the toilets were overflowing so i uh decided to use the girls restroom that's true i i did tell him see but the key that you took was for the boys bathroom are you principal neighbors yes i am i got the fingerprint kit now we can see who the suspect really is wonderful it's right here thank you mikey you were saying what what was the thing mikey if you had a key to the boys restroom how did you get into the girls restroom well um you see the the there was a girl and she came out of the restroom so i decided to sneak inside i'm i'm sorry that was wrong i don't know that all sounds a little odd mikey if you are covering up for someone else you young man are in big big trouble i'm telling you everything i know i i swear first of all yes we didn't find any prince but we did notice something odd can you come over and take a look of course it looks like cheese dip cheese dip [Music] mikey you were eating cheese in my classroom what no you see look my hands are clean that's because you just rubbed it all over your shirt that explains why there isn't any prints use a shirt to pull the alarm oh mikey how could you do that especially after all we've been through please just don't tell my mom i didn't think all this was gonna happen i just pulled it because i didn't want to do the pop quiz and just wanted to go to legoland with my friends pop quiz yeah no mikey no i just wanted to play a game with you all a game are you serious you mean i did all this for nothing mikey you're coming to my office right now no please i'm sorry actually i have to stop you there principal thank you officer thank you you don't know how much i appreciate that mikey's actually gonna come with us what pulling the fire alarm is a serious crime you didn't know that a crime yes it is i'm going to take you downtown governor sir turn

take everything seriously","hi i'm alexa from chicago please like and subscribe i think i decided when i was born that i liked my mom way more than my dad she and i were always super close mom owned a lovely book shop in the neighborhood that had been in the family for generations and ever since i was a little kid it was my favorite place to be but my twin sister bailey was always closer to dad and i didn't know why if there was a prize for the messiest most irresponsible man on the planet he'd surely win and i was allergic to mess daddy you left your muddy boots over my white shoes again are you saying something honey i can't hear you maybe you would if you stopped playing the video game shut up you're so annoying can't you let us have some fun you robot i threw my shoe at bailey when she said that but i couldn't do the same to dad cause he was my dad he just worked some odd part-time jobs and the rest he spent at home playing video games and being messy but once when i was in first grade he really went too far he took bailly and me to the park and while we were on the swings he went off to play football with some boys bailey and i didn't realize how much time had gone by till it started getting dark we looked around for dad but we couldn't find him anywhere alexa i i don't know the way back home i don't either but it's okay we have each other we'll be fine i suddenly remembered the park was close to mom's bookstore and i took bailey's hand and made my way there mom was just closing up and she was shocked to see us she took us home furiously and we found dad sitting on the couch with his muddy boots looking totally unbothered hurry up ladies don't let the big man starve dinner time he didn't even realize he'd left us at the park mom and dad got into the biggest fight ever and the next day dad packed up his bags and left saying he was moving in with his mom and well he never visited or came back bailey was super upset but i was secretly relieved and mom seemed happier too good riddance men were the worst growing up i even avoided talking to boys my age i was certain they were just all messy and careless like dad like once in fifth grade the teacher made a boy sit next to me for a class activity and he was a complete chatterbox worse he messed up the order of all my markers dude can't you see that the pink cap doesn't go with the green marker ma'am where can i find a no boys class it's not possible alexa you'll have to learn to get along with everybody yes even the boys the boy grinned at me and i grabbed a marker and scribbled all over his face the teacher called my mom and i got a bunch of lectures but nothing could change my mind boys were icky and i hated them soon after i discovered something that really interested me acting i joined the drama club and there i found myself fighting for the lead roles every year with a girl named lily i mostly beat her to them and obviously she hated me by the time we were in high school all the boys knew i wouldn't care to talk with them so they stopped trying but lily wouldn't stop annoying me about it who are you gonna go to prom with your cat do you stay away from the boys because you know you're ugly and no one will like you once i walked into the locker room as she was changing and she shrieked omg are you trying to get a peek at me i know you're into girls but don't even think about me yikes no even if i was into girls i have good tastes lily but she spread rumors around the school that i secretly liked her and was spying like a creep when she was changing why don't you go and prove her wrong go on just talk to a boy i'd rather sprinkle cat litter on broccoli and eat that yuck you're a savage and so weird yeah bailey was nothing like me she was really popular with the guys and she was always dating one and i was always afraid she'd end up choosing someone exactly like dad once she was getting ready to go out with a boy i knew was a jerk but she wouldn't listen to me so i had to do something myself that evening i opened the door when he knocked so your mark no wait she said he's hot are you shane no no no he comes on a motorbike every time you must be the rich donkey she was talking about what she said that and who are all these guys i don't know maybe you should ask peter he and bailey have been really close lately he got pissed and left and when bailey found out she was furious now you're spoiling my chances too okay what's up with you and boys don't you find them cute and fun i find them useless and annoying and i don't know why you're dying to be with one you're too young anyway just stay away from them but she'd never do that one evening i realized that i'd left some important notes in my locker and i had to go back to school to get them just then i heard a beautiful voice from the boy's locker room i took a peek through the door and saw someone singing along with his guitar it was ryan the quiet millionaire who joined school a week ago and had all the girls drooling i stood there quietly and continued to listen until he stopped and looked right at me so do you like it oh god he saw me it didn't make my ears bleed so i guess it was all right you're the famous man-hater aren't you i'm flattered to have you as a fan but i'll have to give you my autograph another time i don't have a pen right now oh that's too bad i want to cry but i left my hanky at home i'd offer you mine but it's full of boogers anyway what are you doing here so late i got bored and decided to find my prince charming here at school and you same reason i was waiting for someone as pretty as you to secretly listen to me as i sing so is this the part where we fall in love and start dating no i think we should get married right away and have kids suddenly i noticed his boots they were covered with mud you know there's a reason i stay away from boys and i'm certain you're no different with that i walked away this ryan seemed really full of himself and to my dismay i found out a few days later that he was being paired with me as the lead in the school play but he seemed more disappointed than me ma'am can't we choose someone else to play the heroines part what's your problem why are you trying to get me out of the play because i don't want to play the part with a girl who's allergic to boys we'll have no chemistry i don't have to like you to be good at acting i can fake chemistry uh there's a kissing scene you sure you're up for it yeah i'm a professional and we don't need to practice it we can just do it on the day of the play fine by me i'm an expert anyway we started rehearsing soon with lily as my understudy but her main role seemed to be flirting with ryan and he was just as annoying as any boy i'd ever met he was late for rehearsals he was always eating on set and making a mess and he had to take a hundred breaks but i had to admit he was a good actor and was perfect for the part a few days later we were doing a dress rehearsal and soon after wearing my costume my back really started to itch i somehow made it through my part and then rushed to the dressing room i looked at my back in the mirror at the huge ugly burn mark i'd had since i'd been in an accident when i was eight years old the costumes material had really irritated my scar and it was all red and itchy i took a picture in the mirror to send to my skin doctor and then quickly changed into my clothes but as i picked up my phone again i realized that i'd sent the picture to freaking ryan oh my god feeling panicked i texted him that i sent the picture by mistake but he never replied i just slipped out and headed home feeling really worried i was certain that jerk would show it to everyone especially lily but the next day when i went to school no one was looking at me weirdly or talking about me no one brought it up at all later i spotted ryan by himself in the hallway and i walked over to him hey listen thank you for not sharing that picture with anyone i know i'm an ugly freak what picture the one i sent you yesterday i'm pretty sure you didn't see our chat no picture here he looked up at me and smiled and i found myself smiling back wow that's the first time i've seen you smiling i don't think you should do that it's not a great look on you it just rolled my eyes and walked away okay he wasn't a jerk but he was still annoying but it was nice of him to pretend he didn't receive the picture to not embarrass me when the day of the play finally came i was super excited our performances were going really smoothly well until the kissing scene uh what are you doing you're supposed to kiss me now yeah i know that i'm just getting ready it's just a kiss kiss me alexa fine i put my hands on his face and my heart was racing as our lips touched i felt something i'd never felt before and i was kind of disappointed when he pulled away and started saying his next dialogue back at home bailey couldn't stop teasing me about the kiss in our chemistry on stage which i completely denied and slammed the door in her face but i couldn't stop thinking about the kiss all night was i catching feelings for ryan but the next morning i forgot all about it when i went down for breakfast and found mom crying mom what's wrong what happened i'm going to lose the bookstore it turned out that mom had taken a big loan a while back from an investment company to keep the bookstore running but lately she hadn't been able to make the payments on time and now the company was demanding that she pay it immediately and the investment company belonged to lilly's dad i'll have to sell the bookstore it's not been doing well for a while and i'm just not making enough but mom you love that bookstore everyone in the neighborhood loves it it's been around for 30 years there has to be a way we can save it i don't think there is honey i felt really heavy-hearted when i went to school that day i was sitting alone on the bleachers at recess when suddenly ryan joined me what's up with your face today and to my horror i started to cry i buried my face in my arms as i sobbed and i felt ryan putting his arm around me hey what's going on do you want to talk about it and i found myself telling him everything when i was done he handed me his hanky and looked at me i might have a solution for your problem what what do you mean i guess you don't know that lily's dad and my dad are business partners they both own that investment company i'll talk to my dad today and ask him to make the loan payments easier for you guys i don't want you to lose that bookstore it seems like it means a lot to you do you do you really mean that will your dad agree he will i promise i was so thrilled that i threw my arms around him in a bear hug he hugged me too and we just stayed like that for a while ryan did you just smell my hair what no i didn't why are you helping me because i'm not a jerk is that all yeah don't worry i wouldn't fall for someone who's decided to hate boys for all eternity well maybe i don't hate you ryan's face suddenly lit up and he drew me close and kissed me and it felt amazing true to his word ryan talked to his dad and mom was ecstatic when the company told her they changed their decision and ryan and i well much to everyone's surprise and lily's anger we started dating i couldn't believe i had a boyfriend prom came around a few months later and when bailey and i reached school i spotted ryan from afar looking so cute i walked up to him and was about to kiss him when he suddenly stopped me hey alexa wait there's something i need to talk to you about okay why the serious face he led me out of the hall and then he spoke listen i hate that i'm ruining prom for you but i just have to tell you now um our company is facing some losses and lilly's data is insisting that we collect all outstanding loans so i'm afraid your mom will have to make the full payment very soon i am so sorry i felt the ground slit beneath my feet are you kidding me you promised and now you're just breaking it just like that it's not my decision alexa i don't own the company then maybe it wasn't your promise to make either did you just do it to get together with me to win me over and you never really meant it what are you talking about of course i meant it i tried to help you can't you at least see that no all i can see is that you gave us false hope i would have been better if you hadn't why is everyone so disappointing well maybe your standards are too freaking high well maybe i'm just better off alone i stormed out of there in angry tears i'd made a mistake believing a stupid boy and even a bigger mistake of falling for him high school had come to an end and bailey and i helped mom pack up the store over the summer it broke our hearts to lose it but there was nothing we could do one day as bailey and i were going back home we walked past a cafe where i spotted several kids from school including ryan and lily and she was clinging onto his arm bailey saw my face and said you don't know they're together alexa i'm pretty sure that they are and i really don't care i went off to university to study drama and theater and i was having an amazing time i made loads of cool friends yes even guys and i realized i'd been foolishly stubborn to think they were all bad sometimes i even regretted being so hard on ryan and driving him away he was just a high school kid like me back then and it wasn't his fault that we lost her bookstore soon after graduation i went back home to attend bailey's wedding her husband seemed a lot more sensible than dad and she seemed really happy and i was happy for them later that night someone rang the doorbell and i was shocked when i opened the door hello alexa standing outside was ryan um hi what are you doing here i've been in touch with bailey she said you were coming back for her wedding i really wanted to talk to you i stepped out onto the porch and he said something completely unexpected you know i never forgot about that burn scar on your back my scar that's what you want to talk about yeah i've never stopped thinking about how you saw yourself with it or how painful it must be for you i found an amazing skin surgeon and he can fix it alexa and if you agree to go for it i'd like to pay for the surgery but why are you doing this i swear i'm only doing it as a friend i know i let you down all those years ago and now that i can make some decisions on my own i want to do this i stopped being mad at you a long time ago ryan you don't have to do this i want to please don't say no after a lot of thinking i agreed i underwent the surgery a week later and when i woke up ryan was by my side smiling the doctor said it went great i can't thank you enough ryan i really owe you no you don't well i'll accept a cup of coffee it's a date is it maybe i sat up in bed and pulled ryan towards me in a hug you"

we're here at a storage unit complex we're gonna take the grinder we're gonna cut some locks off and we're gonna see if there's any hidden gems okay this one's interesting there's two jeeps [Applause] [Music] [Music] ladies and gentlemen it's time to roll the dice you see we're here at a storage unit complex that belongs to a good friend of mine and he called me the other day and said hey you know i've had this complex we've had it for years uh we're now managing it got rid of the old managers it's been very i guess poorly managed over the years which means there's a lot of units that have either been abandoned or people haven't paid rent in a long long time so basically if you've seen the show storage wars what the is this what's your profanity this is very similar essentially what they do is they put out a notice to the owners of the unit or the people that are renting the unit say hey you have paid rent you have 30 or 60 days or however long it is to get current and if not then we're going to vacate your unit get rid of all the stuff and in doing that that gives them an opportunity to either take it to the dump which is where most stuff goes because most storage units stuff that was left behind is junk but every once in a while you find a hidden gem there's two jeeps so kenny hit me up and he said hey i'll make you a deal i'll sell you i think it's like 10 or 12 units whatever it is i can't remember how many it is i have the exact list but he's like five grand five grand you go go in open them up these haven't been opened in who knows how long and they haven't opened them we're the first ones to get here uh we don't have the keys we're gonna cut the locks off but basically he said five grand um whatever you find you can take but he says the only caveat is you only have like a day to do it because they're trying to get this place done like asap so we have basically this afternoon to figure out what i just spent five grand on i don't know if this was a good idea or a bad idea because ttyl bro well first of all the area where we're at is very remote it's kind of a rural little town the storage units haven't been in the best shape for the past you know several years but they've done a good job they've got a fence around the place they're it's in way better condition now than it was you know six months ago but basically what we're going to do is we're going to take the grinder we're going to cut some locks off and we're gonna see if there's any hidden gems and anything that we think is worthwhile we're gonna load up and take away and anything that's not worthwhile we're gonna hopefully not get hepatitis from touching it be careful and then they're gonna take it and hold it off in the dumpster so there's gotta be something so anyways uh we're gonna get over here with kenny and ted and go over the list and start uh popping units open all right it's butcher box time let's see what we've got here tenderloins we have some ground beef we got ribeye steaks and i am pumped for this all right let's put these bad boys [Music] yeah baby look at those rib eyes [Music] what's that smell it smells smells really i'm just good

simple i'm trying to keep this ad as short as possible because it doesn't require much talking because these bad boys speak for themselves now i'm going to enjoy these while you go order yours [Music] basically right here i have a list of the see how they have the numbers on them uh the list shows uh units that were either you know the owner never came and got their stuff um some units that just have random stuff in them that really can't really even explain because they were never attached to anybody's name we got one two three four five six seven eight nine eight seven three two five ten eleven twelve so roughly two units is what we're gonna go through i'll tell you which ones i want right now i want four seven and twelve why do you want four seven and twelve don't know no where are we go [Music] like you meet my brother-in-law kenny guthrie he married my guys sister and he works for my friend kenny who owns the storage unit complex and you've been having a hell of a time out here it's been great man there's a lot of weird going a lot of weird a lot of interesting characters firewood did we buy this one so this one this one doesn't necessarily say it's on the list just says stuff so the one doesn't say stuff just a vacant unit that is available but somebody came and put stuff in it so we've just got to clean it out somebody's basically squatting their stuff here yeah it's a good fire that's a great firewood yeah every storage unit i feel like looks the same but then they look completely different once you start going through the stuff like you open it's just like oh my gosh like years worth of clutter alan's here this is uh by the way guys this is right near allen's compound if you look high up on the mountain over there somewhere you'll see it so allen feels right at home and uh we got the lost boys over here not me evening i'm hunter my dad suffered we brought a lot of muscle because we have a lot of to move three generations here there's there's alan he's grandfather grandpa allen father then the lost boys believe that's my dad who me i can see the resemblance no let's not start making claims that's how adoption works hey choose our dad stand side by side and say that was forced [Laughter] there was nothing forced into that things just got weird [Laughter] these lofty units we have no idea what's in them so there very well could be squatters i mean if there's a lock on it then they would have to have some sort of engine but there's still just some weird stuff going on so everybody's be kind of careful nobody get nobody yeah [Music] please don't shoot any squatters the first one on the list number six you want to use bolt cutters no this looks better than one of those rectangular ones that are hard to cut you can try it give it a whirl use those muscles oh hope it comes up horse mask is that your exact same couch with the hanger what's depressing is dave and i have a storage unit that looks almost identical to this oh boy welcome rock box did you just put that on well okay i don't think there's anything so taking this home right to it that's it oh wow i think i might need to blur that there's probably a leg wow i think we might have to glorify that but it's a decent rack so this is this is where i probably have to step away because i'm a bit of a hoarder and i'll try to keep everything unfortunately that's a nice little grill though make sure we don't let's grill this nice dolly okay well guys anything that looks valuable start pulling out this is some pretty decent furniture actually i don't see anything grill good fire [Music] rock look i told i told you allen was trying to play it cool camera turns off i turn around he's got it like this walking always like this is actually pretty cool guys think garage sale think anything that we can make five thousand dollars back on hey you want that for the competition yeah the compound anything you want for the compound okay hey that's actually a pretty nice little sink you're not european dresser of some sort has like the top for everything furniture is the hardest thing to deal with though because the biggest takes up the most space that's the most labor intensive we're looking for hot ticket items right now there we go wait is that a car bear statue yeah all right so this person was in the bears and love hey another gun rack two for two on gun racks there's a bunch of games these games these games actually bring good money on ebay oh have you ever seen a billiard trophy before oh man from the snowy river that's a good one that's a great show welding homer simpson operation how about that that's in great condition still with the cards and everything so much knowledge knowledge there's so many couches wait if we can find the where's the pair this one looks more like ours but dig in there come on guys chase is on the case man looks like chase has been off the case for a little bit he's still got his walmart receipt on him why would you spend all the effort putting this uh junk in here have you seen your house your compound man that's the same thing but with army trucks that's not worth money oh you tell me this isn't nothing valuable i'll give you five bucks drive right now i doubt it prove it i have a magic trick i can make this disappear watch this see it's gone [Music] down here 25. convertible this is the car we're wrecking a plymouth voyager [Music] now we got their blood pumping diesel we found a convertible no keys so the air cleaner is dirty all right now it's dry bone dry there's there's some scrap value there looks like it was stolen though so trying to scrap the stolen vehicle scraps at like 230 a ton right now i think probably weighs four thousand pounds that's probably 500 bucks [Music] so far this is not looking like a great investment [Laughter] oh [Music] so this one apparently the guy just decided to cut down the back wall and just kind of walk the other side and help himself to one big unit and it's got some decent stuff in here be careful with the hood it's like i don't believe in opening okay this one's interesting there's obviously a lot of automotive stuff but more importantly there's two jeeps [Music] where's dave al yeah so take a look at this hunter i don't need another project you know that no more projects for you but hey okay that's a complete exclusive diesel engine [Music] this was i don't i can't i don't know which model specifically jeep this is i'm sure jeep guys are going crazy right now watching this because i'm so ignorant but it's got the sliding door so it's gotta be like the opening that one's gonna be an old mail this one doesn't have a sliding door start getting anything valuable out of this one start moving it out this one is definitely very interesting somebody had a lot of projects going on that's a safe this is a whole world war ii thing with pictures all over the place a lot of interesting stuff in here it's like a furnace of some sort [Music] so depending on what these are there's definitely some value i think we're for sure take these the engine nice little diesel engine which was probably scheduled to be put in this weather seal gaskets and lights conference tables we found two military hoists in there we took them out yeah military hoists that's a stink [Music] [Music] ragnar thank you very much and begin to spin away with her silky thread i'll let you take over the top yeah a little bit taller a little taller i think it's just wedged up though i think there's still something holding it [Music] we're fitness people we got speedo goggles oh he shoots he scores irish spring full bar no way ah unopened now we have easy access to the jeeps uh cuba [Music] i think it's like colorado or something whoa chinese lanterns hand crafted if you light one off let's try these knights oh blue obviously we really like this on fire right now [Music] [Music] yeah is it working well that's your trick here's my trick i nail it no it's not on oh that's good i have it yeah but film it from this way wait so you want me down here bombs away [Applause] [Music] kind of work let's play one on fire [Music] [Music] did you break [Music] third oh doing a lantern festival yeah i bet i've got an oxy of a settling torch okay then how do we like that we're on fire now i'm not gonna lie i never did this as a kid nope you're right right so hope this is how it goes is it working what come on fire [Music] up yes yes hey i count this as a win right here worth the investment dave i can't even grab it it's so high plus we burned all the storage units down it's gone david just like that we gotta just take it [Music] looking at it yeah thank you wasn't anticlimactic was it that's awesome yeah that was that turned out great my couple's my kids i don't like the death wobble so crazy i love that for us you know what i think it's safe to say this is the nicest one there's an air fryer so where's that here we go hands thanks a couple of hot rods in here these are pretty neat that's like the first time hen's ever let another man touch him i it was because it was two sweaters [Music] microwave i wanna close a million dollars [Music] i do like that mower [Music] this though be my daily five speed gear 13 horsepower ohv so we try to make a prosthetic leg out of a roller skate i keep thinking you're throwing at me you got me three times somebody was living in here that's so violent go go in there oh this is just nasty [Music] we are down to the final unit number 87. uh way tucked out here on the backside so [Music] oh wait that's worth something ttyl bro why who who's that for what's the demographic that buys the hat besides you oh you get so much joy out of that picture yeah i'm gonna make my dog do the same pose okay well 87 was a bust all right guys uh our work here is done i think we went through end up being like 13 or 14 different units a lot of stuff that we expected just pure trash but we did find some treasures which are these two jeeps i have no idea what they're worth um but they're worth something to someone because there's there's always a market for for these old vehicles got a furnace that says worse said it was worth a thousand bucks uh got a cool little isuzu diesel engine that uh that could be kind of cool i don't know what it's from or if it runs between the two trailers unless we got something real rare or special maybe one of those jeeps i don't even think we got five grand worth of stuff maybe maybe but most likely not what do you think how much do you think we got a couple grand for the jeeps probably yeah the only scrap value of whatever metal we have sorry if i'm a little pessimistic yeah i'm uh i mean there's there's a couple items that might sell but found some weird stuff found some gross stuff found in someone's one bedroom apartment and we found a bunch of old tools and a couple of jeeps so i would say all in all i'm entertained [Music]"

day of working on the heavy wrecker we have got a lot to do to get this finished but all i'm worried about is the next step and the next step is we need the drivetrain in here we need the engine transformation and traps for case so after doing a little research and talking with some friends i have decided that i want the big block 496 it's known as the 8.1 chevrolet motor some people call it the big block ls even though it's not and we'll never call it that again we decided on what type of engine to run like two days ago so we headed up to my friend gumby's junkyard to see if he had anything that we could use in this good morning i'm out looking for parts looking for engine transmission just other parts maybe some parts for some other build i'm going to be meeting up with paul from fab rats robbie layton going to be meeting johnny boy tom tom we're all heading up to my buddy gumby's place to look through his junkyard he's got a junkyard there at lake point we're just gonna kind of have a fun day looking at stuff there's actually a few things that we need to do on the way there while we're there and on the way back and i'm gonna show you those as we're doing them trevor's back at the shop he's working on the cab kind of getting it stripped down and cleaned up a little bit i'm going to be meeting paul here in a few minutes we're going to be going to jace's house in gunnison he's got to pick up a front seat for the giveaway car that he's been working on so that's what's happening next well i'm here a half hour late so this is my buddy jace you know his brother rowdy from charlton's that's what he's my steel dealer looks like paul and michelle are gonna forgive me for being late she said we don't need to get up that early matt's going to be late all right so paul got his seat from jace i did most of the work now we're headed to robbie's jay says he's not coming not because he got a coach little league but i did invite him so it hurt that i turned yeah yeah and we're even now well even for what do i owe you something oh yeah you got a cold mountain dew all right well thanks guys we'll see you next time and we'll derby sometime in the future hopefully so the next stop we have is robbie leighton's i'm going to be picking up the trailer to take up to johnny boys for tom tom to fix that'll all make sense when you see it we're going to be picking up robbie we're going to be taking some exhaust to get coated but that is the next stop we're here we made it to robbie leighton's the famous robbie lake five days with no monsters i didn't realize you were addicted to monsters oh bad it was movie magic i only had two that day but i know but like but even still like they're horrible for you robby and i tell him you said you had something for him so a fan came by two days ago and gave us a roof rack for his 400 so it's got it's just a factory but it'll work until you get something aftermarket but it's got all the caps it's got all the bolts do you know how the roof is leaking this will stop the rain from coming in yes we'll grab that on the way back tyler thank you so much all right so we're here at robbie's shop we got a couple things to pick up here we got the exhaust for the golden nugget that's getting coated so we also got to pick up the trailer take it up tom tom's going to fix it in johnny's shop the tongue of the trailer was a guest they guessed wrong now they're going to get it right all right we're coming in here to where the real work happens oh look at that so um i can't believe how good this color looks like sometimes when you paint things that the color like doesn't match what the thing is the color matches this thing oh it's i think it's perfect now matt this isn't as hard as robbie says it is all right so this is great i came up here with paul we came to check out the golden nugget see how the work's been going on cody robbie dinner holy smokes hillbilly you guys have been just pranking on this thing it is beautiful like things always show up better on video this is better in person than it is on video i'm super excited about this so i'm gonna give him a passing grade and uh give you one more month to work on it okay or i'm repossessing it no no three more weeks no we got a month no he said a month three we have one month all right so so robbie negotiated me down to three weeks all right so here's the trailer tom guessed on the tongue height i don't even know if guest is the right word but that's where it got built it's wrong it's low like 16 inches it's pretty low it's pretty low so we're going to load this up in the truck we're going to take it up there tom's going to meet us at johnny boys he's going to fix it we're going to bring it back tonight okay let's get this loaded remember it's here i'm going to do my part so they're just blasting this they're just blasting it and then they're picking it back up on them coating it here all right okay grab your stuff let's get out of here so our next stop is powder extreme coatings to drop off the nugget exhaust and then from there we're headed to thule out in the tools so we just got the exhaust dropped off at powder extreme coatings they're going to get it blasted up prismatic powders are going to pick it up take it to robbie's shop and show them how to do the coding next stop johnny boy's house and tom tom's there waiting for us with his welding mitts on oh i caught you slacking off over here all right so we're here with tom tom and his bill stein shirt we're here with johnny boy not in his bilstein shirt we're gonna let it slide this time okay all right we're gonna get that trailer in here we're gonna get it fixed right now who's doing what yeah this is your baby all right you broke it you gotta fix it okay johnny boy tell me one more time what i need to do he needs to go over there and eyeball this he needs me to eyeball it and i am on it this is what i do i've trained my whole life for this moment johnny go that way like one half of a degree put that other tack on [Music] all right are you happy with that i sure am when we built this i thought we were going to use a drop hitch coming off of the golden nugget and we could just keep this nice and flat but it has a really weird receiver tube on the back so we can't just buy a drop hitch for it so instead we're building a gooseneck to make this come up and meet it so we got a number 29 and 3 8 is where the ball is this is gonna have to come up then we'll come over and we'll have our hitch right here at golden nugget height 29 and three eighths right there [Music] look at that gooseneck holy smokes [Music] yeah you saw here first all right so here's the deal we've got this fixed we're gonna leave it here we're gonna load it up later it's now time to play because that's what we came here for the whole reason for this whole entire trip that everything else got tacked onto is about to happen now i have a dumb question [Music] somebody already asked that dumb question never mind i'll just wait for the video all right so we are loaded up paul's already taken off he's probably going to go try to find all the good stuff first so we're about to put the we're about to drop the hammer that's what they say we're about to get blue still moving all right this is the real reason we came there's real re there no you never do think one thing at a time you do everything this is the main this is the core of the apple right here in case you can't tell some of us are pretty excited about what's about to go down i've got i will show you inside of buildings there's just lots and lots of garbage do you have a do you have any known good 8.1 the cars were around here when we took possession we're here before the 8.1 came out this game so this is amazing it's kind of overwhelming all right we think we may have found something we've got what appears to be a six liter ls engine it's a great power plant for lots of things looks like robbie chased down some kind of a jump box how many miles are on it 213 000. yeah i checked the oil and checked everything did it say anything power steering work transmission probably no driveway we found our little gem in the junkyard and it runs yeah best part is it runs so johnny boy found the third seat for his suburban you know the suburban it's the one that he was using to climb up slip lock but i heard that that suburban's going to alaska up to his cabin up there so say goodbye to the suburban but at least it'll have a third seat oh he's already got it that was fast okay close that door they're just really friendly so you can't see them that's why they call them no siems i call them nats but they biting they're fighting all of us fighting that's in the hordes they last here in lake point for about three weeks till it gets to about 86 87 degrees and it burns them off you all just picked the most prime time yeah it's feeding season so we came we looked at some stuff all of us looked at all of us was just looking at stuff for a while we found some stuff paul got him a couple things got a car axles i found myself an engine that i was looking for johnny boy got a back seat tom tom found some back axles he's gonna look for and then this is kind of a sore spot right on the waiting list right robbie's on the waiting list for a couple of six o's we're going back to johnny boys i'm getting some stuff that tom tom brought for me i'm giving him some stuff that i brought for him and then we're going to dinner all right so i had tom tom bring me down some cool stuff i left all the birds on there so you could clean them up let's give lizzy something to do look at that that is the dana 60 that's going in the front of the banana oh you're doing it finally yes about time after five broken youtubers do you remember way back when early in our friendship when you were building the banana yeah and i said just put one tons in it and save yourself a whole bunch of trouble here he is following your advice yeah like seven years later what a good friend does he listen there's no chance is there okay guys you think we can just throw this up in there [Music] look at that so here's where we're at we got the trailer loaded in the truck we got the axle loaded into the truck we got the plates loaded in the truck thank you tom got the gooseneck fixed johnny boy got the parts first thing i'm hiring trevor here to pull the engine out of the yukon denali gumby's going to be bringing that by tomtom you got everything you needed yeah i'm ready robbie got some promises and we're going to dinner johnny's not coming though because he hates driving in the salt lake that's right don't worry i got some crackers i can eat or something all right well thank you thank you for coming it was fun so i owe robbie like 12 more dinners tom tom's filling in for big dinner and for hillbilly tonight so oh matt's getting off easy you got your work cut out for you because i'm making the stay until you eat it so you guys probably don't know scott yet oh you've seen him on fabret's channel some of you have but you're going to be seeing him a lot more because he's going to be helping us with the hydraulics on the heavy wrecker okay we're done eating we got a long drive ahead of us me and robbie back up to idaho falls everybody else we don't even know if paul and michelle are going to find a motel tonight yeah there is available tonight so uh it might be the truck for us all right me and robbie are back at robbie's shop dinner came down here got the telehandler ready so we can lift this trailer out and get it dropped off robbie can go to bed and i can go home we got a long drive ahead of you yeah all right so we've got robbie dropped off we've got a three-hour drive so that's where i'm headed now good morning it is a new day and we're here in the shop but not for long because we're headed back up to northern utah to pick up a suburban that johnny boy bought so the whole reason i went up to gumby's junkyard in the first place was to try to find a motor for this record well on the way home last night johnny boy called me and he said hey there is a suburban with an 8.1 in it for sale right in his town and he went over and looked at it said it was worth buying so long story short johnny boy ended up buying it now we're going up to grab it we're gonna pull the motor out of it and we're gonna stick it in this record four hours later we arrive at johnny boys so like i said after i came up here to find parts at gumby shop and left that's when johnny boyd calls me and says hey there's one for sale locally with an 8.1 so that's why we're back here and this is it [Music] oh my goodness look at that there it is the whole thing's made out of metal and plastic yep she's a beaut clark all right thank you johnny for helping me find this for going calling the guy test driving it doing all that stuff yep so the plan is to get it loaded up on the trailer drive all the way back to hurricane tomorrow morning trevor's gonna pull this motor and we're gonna drop it in the frame of the wrecker that's what's gonna happen next all right so do any of you recognize this guy lt from trump tech powernation tv that's right back in the day now you're you've got a youtube channel lawrence tolman yeah lars lt tolman and i i have fun and i built trucks pretty much still doing the same cool stuff engine swaps tuning going fast exactly yeah all right the reason we're looking at this truck is this is an 8.1 liter he's got a bunch of stuff done to it he's got the turbocharger and high flow injectors what other stuff well basically this is a this is a pretty simple setup that's a 100 complete bone stock junkyard 8.1 of course it does have the 80 millimeter turbo on the side big injectors but i have not cracked this thing open once um stock valve spring stock ring gap and it makes only 580 horsepower but 906 pounds of torque on 14 pounds of boost all right so lawrence here told me that i want an 8.1 in the heavy wrecker and with his credentials i decided to listen to him and the more i find out the more i realize he knows what he's talking about so that's why i bought the suburban and he was on the way home so i'm like hey i'm going to drop in and crash his party tonight and look at his stuff so we're gonna stand here and look at it for a minute you're probably gonna see a little bit more of lawrence in the future as we're building the heavy wrecker because he's my 8.1 guru so my only question is how long is it going to take for me to convince you that you need one of those on the side i've already thought about it i think we're gonna leave it pretty stock at first it might take some talking to get me to do one of those if we have room so we're gonna be here for a minute and then it's back on the road you're gonna see us tomorrow morning pulling the motor in the suburban and working on the heavy wrecker look at that this is the suburban that johnny boy found me i'm super happy with it i call it exhaust leak because the exhaust is rusted out all right so we've got to get into the shop we've got to get the wrecker out we've got to get the suburban in and then trevor's going to pull the motor [Music] ugh look at that that's a big old boy all right we're gonna jump into this oh yeah let's get after it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well i'm going to pull the rest of this wiring harness because johnny boy wanted it saved and then disconnects the drive lines and the motor mounts and transmission mounts and comes out i think we'll find out we sure will so trevor and lizzy and i think erica worked on it they were able to get this down to this point today that was crazy a lot of work got done today i do want to talk to you about what we're going to be doing next week so the plan next week is to get this lifted out of here and we're going to keep it together and set it in the record get us an idea of how it's going to lay in there something that's interesting that i found out about this motor is this was called the duramax killer back in 2003 this motor would outpull a duramax not by much but it was it had more torque than a duramax but the downside of that is it burned three times more fuel to get that job done but it has a very quick throttle response gobs and gobs of torque 455 pounds of torque as it sets right now and it's pretty much done making power at just before 5000 rpm so it's kind of a low rpm torque monster that has a lightning quick throttle response that is why i chose this motor right so i'm super excited to get this set in the wrecker and see if we can get the cab fit around it how intrusive it's going to be in the cab and just figuring out all that stuff my goal is to keep the cab about where it is as close as possible hopefully we can do that so once again i'd like to thank all of you that have donated for the all abilities part but i'd also like to thank all of you that watch the videos that is a great way to support what we're doing here with these fundraisers appreciate that for those of you that want to donate and haven't yet your time is running out midnight tonight is when we're gonna be closing that so just a heads up on that now we're gonna go eat hot dogs thanks for watching got skunked huh peacocks two matt zero"

Go To The Clown Motel","many questions still swirling about why these clown encounters are sweeping the country right now an old mining cemetery is a stone's throw away this is an absolute nightmare the scariest one in all of america one guest said that he woke up and there was a large life-sized clown like the one in the corner standing in front of his bed sometimes when i go go sitting out here my battery goes out you've never seen a place like this welcome to clown motel clown motel clown motel clown motel and the clown motel [Music] [Applause] [Music] a casino we're here boys we're driving it's like getting like 85 degrees out and then the sun drops and it's now snowing and there's clowns and i'm scared there it is the clown hotel oh my god oh [ __ ] it's literally right next to the [ __ ] graveyard okay the vibe just totally changed as soon as we pulled in here dude i think we should go home dude it's [ __ ] real i feel like i've been here before this was just some dumb pavlov map this is just a little game it's the only map we had available it's gone a little bit too far we need to go home the vibe totally changed as soon as i saw that graveyard right there i'm not joking man we need to go home we need to go home like back to australia dude there's just people in the windows like looking at us like are they even real that's the owner dude i've seen him in the documentary that's him is it yeah look at that his friend just showed up he's an actual clown dude i shot myself with a rocket launcher from that roof whenever you see someone say rip bozo on twitter is this where they end up we got here it's night time we're about to check in we haven't looked inside yet uh spoiler alert it's full of clowns my guy it smells like [ __ ] in here for two bucks how

paintings and slashed that headboard to pieces you talk about rick's neighbor right rick lives here by the way he's the groundskeeper that lives here legitimately and over the past couple hours he's been following us around me and eddie put the key in our door just before didn't turn around and he's like pointing at the paintings he walked into our room he did yeah that's why dude this is the

Nissan Z Is a Legend Revived","this is the new 2023 nissan z and it's the return of a legend the nissan z car which has been a staple in nissan's high performance lineup going back decades more than 50 years to the late 1960s early 1970s well now it's back the all-new z and today i'm going to review it [Music] before i get started be sure to check out cars and bins which is my enthusiast car auction website with free listings for sellers you can list your car for free and pay no fees and auction it on cars and bids and we've had some great sales recently including this mazda miata 30th anniversary edition sold for just under 37 000. this fantastic 2013 toyota land cruiser brought just under 50 000. and this wonderful mercedes amg gtr sold for over a hundred and sixty two thousand dollars if you're looking to buy or sell a cool enthusiast car from the modern era the 1980s and up cars and bids is the place to do it with daily auctions and great selection at carsandbins.com so let's talk nissan z like i said this car has been a fixture in nissan's performance lineup going back years decades even although it sort of comes and goes sometimes a z model will go away or be cancelled and it'll be years before a replacement emerges this one follows up on the 370z which went out of production a few years ago but now it's back and it's mostly new and on paper it's pretty appealing under the hood is a twin turbo v6 that makes 400 horsepower and it's mated to a six-speed manual transmission although a 9-speed automatic is also available and these are only offered in rear-wheel drive those are some of the makings of a great sports car so today i'm going to review the new z and find out just how great it really is first i'll take you on a thorough tour of the new zea and show you its quirks and features then i'll get it out on the road and drive it and then i'll give it a dug score all right i'm going to start the crooks and features the new nissan z with one important detail about the new z and that would be that it shares its platform with the old 370z now i mentioned this because toyota has told us that it doesn't make financial sense to develop a sports car by yourself which is why they used bmw as a partner for the new supra well nissan has done that but they've done it in part by sharing the platform with the outgoing model which came out back in 2009 so you got kind of an old platform here for the new z but while the new z shares its platform with the outgoing model virtually everything else is changed compared to the old 370z including the engine gone is nissan's beloved naturally aspirated v6 na engines are just too hard to get past fuel economy and emissions regulations anymore but instead we have something pretty special under here this is a twin turbo three liter v6 that makes 400 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque and it's standard in all new z models is it like the supra where there's a base model with a smaller four cylinder whatever all z's are getting this 400 horse twin turbo v6 now 400 horsepower is a pretty healthy number in fact it's about 50 to 70 horsepower more than the outgoing 370z model depending on which verse of the outgoing model you got so a big healthy power boost here now this engine is shared in the nissan world it's shared with the infiniti q50 and q60 red sport models they also have the same powertrain but one key difference is those vehicles are offered with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive the z is gonna be rear-wheel drive only just like you might expect from a sports car and the z is offered like i said six-speed manual transmission or a nine-speed automatic so you can get it either way you can still get your z with three petals but beyond the powertrain being new for the z the exterior styling is also completely new every panel changed the entire outside different and in my opinion very attractive i think the new z looks great elegant relatively simple without some extra unnecessary visual drama like some new cars have this one is simple restrained basic and frankly beautiful it looks like a very attractive sports car and the outside of this car is filled with heritage design details from prior z models in the front you primarily have the original z the old school datsun 240z which you can see in a few places up here for one nissan tells me the headlights there was a certain version of the 240z that had like a glass cover over the headlights and that caused the headlights to kind of look like they were being split into an oval shape which is what nissan tried to go for here with the running lights as you can see in kind of an oval above and below shape which is kind of an interesting throwback you also have a y shape on the hood you can see this line turns into two lines making a y as sort of a power bulge on the hood which is also a throwback to the original 240z but the most obvious original 240z design detail up here is the front grille a large rectangular piece just like a lot of early z models had this one carries on the tradition as well now when the prototype version of this new z was revealed a few years ago that front end design was just a big black grill and it got some harsh criticism so nissan toned it down you can see these little silver kind of rectangles within the grill they're meant to make this big grill look a little less severe it kind of toned down the visual impact of having a big black rectangle in front of the car but the overall design of this grill is a retro throwback to the 240z but anyway next up moving on to the side of this car some other exterior design touches worth pointing out one of which is the door handle you can see kind of a vertical upright and very distinctive door handle this is a throwback to a different nissan z model and that would be the z33 version which debuted back in 2003. it also had a very distinctive vertical door handle and we're seeing that carried over to this version as well a retro throwback to something from the early 2000s also interesting on the side of this car you can see a two-tone design the body is obviously blue but the roof is black these are going to be offered as full body color or you can opt for this two-tone design although if you do the roof part is always black there's no other colors you can deviate the roof you will also see this large chrome trim going down the side right below the roof the entire side of the car has it looks cool adds some visual excitement but it kind of disappears near the end of the car and creates sort of a weird situation back here where the black two-tone part meets the blue paint part and they don't really have a defined separation on the tailgate lid it feels like kind of an unfinished design detail on this car also unusual on the outside of the new z is the fuel door which is absolutely massive you can see it here nissan told me the designers were actually kind of proud of getting this fuel door to have several different surface creases and made it work but i just think it's massive maybe unnecessarily large and frankly it looks a little weird but those are minor design details that look a little strange and an overall car that i really do think looks great but anyway next we move around to the back of the new z and you'll see yet another design detail borrowed from yet another different nissan z car and that would be the tail lights you can see these sort of horizontal lines back here a very distinctive tail light look and that's borrowed from the z32 nissan 300zx from the mid 90s you can see the z32s tail lights here also these horizontal lines and they've brought it back for this new z car and again very distinctive now the way these operate are interesting when you turn on the headlights the tail lights light up as these large vertical ovals inside the tail light assembly when you put on the brake lights they turn on inside the large vertical ovals which looks kind of cool and the turn signal is bright orange and below all of that just sort of a flat vertical piece at the base of this taillight assembly now interestingly the little red ovals on the inside of the taillight assembly don't do anything these are just reflectors they don't really have a purpose they don't light up but they do help kind of further the look of this overall tail light kind of mimicking what you had in the z32 now another notable item back here is the rear spoiler you will see it here and that's because this is a z performance model they're going to be two trims of the new z the base model is called the z sport and the upgraded model this one is called the z performance the z sport will start right at forty thousand dollars before shipping so maybe around 41 after shipping the z performance this model will start right at 50 000 before shipping so like 51 with destination included and there are some upgrades to the z performance on the outside one is the rear spoiler which the base model doesn't have you can see an unspoilered sport model here you also have a front spoiler that's included in the z performance so it's not included in this particular car so we can get on and off trucks for transport more easily but it will be included in the performance the performance also comes with 19-inch wheels you can see here these are the standard wheels and the z performance whereas the sport comes with 18-inch wheels as you can see right here different wheel design and smaller wheels overall and fitting behind those wheels the z performance has larger brakes not much larger but about an inch bigger in front and a little less than that in bags so a little larger brakes than the performance for a little better stopping power but anyway back to the rear of this car a couple things worth noting back here this rear diffuser this is on all models the sport and the performance and it looks good and sporty and exciting and it includes the dual exhausts as you can see and in fact you can even see these little holes on the rim of the exhaust which looks cool that's borrowed from the q60 and q50 red sport they have the same exhaust tips unfortunately this powertrain doesn't quite sound as good as the old naturally aspirated engine take a listen now another notable item back here is badging you can see z is printed on the back of this car and that is in fact its name there was some speculation nissan was going to call it the 400z the prior one was the 370z the 350z the 300zx well that's all gone the numbers are gone it's just z that's what they're calling it that's what the badge says and that is its only name one other thing worth pointing out with the badge every previous z has had sort of a distinctive z font this car doesn't instead it uses the original font from the original 240z so kind of a heritage font in here one other heritage item in the back you can see subtly printed at the bottom of the rear glass the words since 1969. that's there because the z originally went into production in late 1969 as a 1970 model and this car carries forward the tradition hence this little kind of easter egg written into the bottom of the glass that you may not notice except that i pointed it out to you now also worth pointing out about this rear glass situation is the way that it opens which is kind of clever you don't have some ugly trunk popper instead you reach into the bottom half of the nissan logo as you can see here you reach in press it and then it pops open and you can open it the rest of the way from there which would be exceptionally cool a neat way to clean up the rear of the car except for the fact that you do have a backup camera sticking out here next to the nissan logo so they could have integrated that into the nissan logo but instead they did the trunk popper either way something had to stick out which is kind of unfortunate but when you open up the tailgate and the new z you can see the cargo area and there's really nothing of note back here it's pretty much just a cargo area nothing weird interesting exciting you do have a big crossbar going directly behind the seats obviously that's for increased rigidity and better handling and track performance but otherwise it's pretty much just a cargo area nissan tells me that cargo space is unchanged from the outgoing 370z now one thing you can notice from back here is the fact that this car only has two seats which has been pretty standard fare in nissan z models for years now but some prior z's did have back seats well this one doesn't but you do have a little bit of storage behind the front seats as you can see here for a little added practicality if there's some stuff that won't fit in your cargo area but anyway next up we climb inside the new z and one of the things you'll notice if you're familiar with the prior model is there's kind of an interesting mix of new and old in here there's some carryover pieces in this interior that come straight out of the old car for example the parking brake is borrowed from the old cars same with the center switch gear these heated seat buttons and this tailgate button as you can see also the climate controls come out of the old car these circle climate controls with buttons in the center they're lifted straight out of the old 370z model and z enthusiasts will note that same deal with the stocks coming off the steering column turn signal and wiper stock borrowed straight from the old z and same deal with the switch gear on the door panel the power windows the mirrors the lock button all that stuff is off the old z in fact nissan tells me that the door panel in general is pretty much lifted entirely from the old z although it has some new trim in the center this material in here is a little bit different from what you had in the old car a little bit nicer and classier but you will see the same door handle and the same door mounted climate control vent just like you had in the old 370z models now this might be disappointing to some enthusiasts who aren't happy to see some carryover materials switches and other items in this interior from the old z which was already getting criticism for being pretty outdated and now its stuff continues on but it's important to point out again that this carryover is part of what allowed nissan to develop this car and kind of lower the cost and make it financially feasible to create a new z and it's also worth pointing out there is a good bit of new stuff in this interior for example the steering wheel is completely new unique to this car not used in other nissan models and totally new for the z you can see it has a lot of different steering wheel controls on both spokes next to the driver's thumbs very easy to use and nissan told me inspired by the steering wheel in the original r32 nissan skyline gtr now directly above the steering wheel you can see a gauge cluster screen which is shared with other nissan models but new for the z and it has some pretty cool features for one thing full color very high resolution it's a good gauge cluster display system and it's quite configurable you can change the center panel to show you all sorts of different things from vehicle information to music information to navigation stuff there's a lot of good info on the screen and you can see it in various different ways and i especially like how you can change this gauge cluster screen to show slightly different display modes this is the standard motor it looks like a fairly normal gauge cluster but you can also put it in an enhanced mode and then your speed and engine speed kind of gets small and they're pushed over to the side so whatever your center display screen shows can be maximized which is kind of cool cooler still though is the sport mode for this gauge cluster you go into sport mode and then you can see it here and now it focuses on gauges you have your tachometer in the center and other gauges on the side and the configurable part becomes the screen on the left which now shows like sport and performance data you can't see your music information here your phone your navigation but you have g forces and other performance information on the screen all of which is pretty cool one drawback i will point out though about this screen you can't see a full screen navigation map unless you're actively navigating somewhere so you can't just have the map showing up on the screen unless it's taking you to a direction which i find to be kind of disappointing now something very interesting about this car i just showed you the gauge cluster screen in its different modes and usually in most cars the gauge screen changes are linked to drive modes but in this new z if you get the manual transmission there are no drive modes and that means no sport mode no eco mode no comfort mode you can't choose between any of that you can if you get the automatic transmission but if you choose the manual nissan says they feel they've equipped it in a sporty way and so you can't change drive modes which is unusual i can't remember the last modern performance car i got into that didn't let you switch drive modes but this one doesn't kind of an interesting play from nissan you do have one button next to the gear lever that says s mode with kind of a picture of a gear pattern on it that doesn't actually change the modes but instead it turns on the automatic rev matching downshift feature so if you have that on you'll downshift and then the car will automatically rev-match for you which is a nice feature to have and it works well in this car now obviously this feature is only available with the manual transmission which this car has and you can see it here in the center a six-speed manual looks good right where you'd expect it and i'll cover exactly how it shifts and feels when i get this car out on the road later but also worth pointing out here in the center is the infotainment system this is nissan's latest infotainment it's been in a few other cars i recently reviewed the new nissan pathfinder with this system and i went into a little bit more depth in that video i'll link it below so you can check it out but the basics are the system is fine it's good enough it works reasonably well relatively responsive pretty intuitive and i do like the hard buttons at the base of the screen that allow you to go to different places without having to tap the screen you have these always there and you can always rely on them one interesting drawback of this infotainment system though is there's no home screen virtually all rivals have a home screen that'll show you like a few different panels at once the weather for example the music you're listening to and the navigation all in one this card doesn't have that you have to kind of choose a tab that you're on and then that's what you're seeing so you can't see different views at once nor do you have sort of a general overall home screen which is kind of unusual one cool feature though with this car and the map if you have it go to a navigation destination you can actually pull up the google street view of that destination from your car and you can kind of check it out on this screen before you arrive that way you can see like what the parking situation looks like or exactly where you're supposed to pull in that sort of thing all in the center screen which is actually a pretty cool idea that i wish more cars integrated with that said although that is a pretty cool feature a big drawback to this infotainment screen the camera is absolutely atrocious this is the rear view camera the resolution is terrible it looks awful this is clearly a carryover from the previous z model and it is nowhere near as good as most cameras used by rival cars this car also doesn't have any additional camera angle so there's no like surround view 360 top-down camera you don't get any of that stuff and in fact the new z is kind of lacking in general in driver aids you do get adaptive cruise control which is nice and a lane departure warning system and a blind spot alert but there's no driver assist so no like automatic steering or anything like that in this car that's not that big of a deal most sports cars are pretty much like that but worth pointing out with the bad camera also comes sort of a lesser amount of driver aids in case you were hoping to have that but anyway beyond the tech in this interior moving on to some other interesting quirks and features in here one notable item is the cup holder situation in the center console you have a cup holder as you can see but if you pull back this center armrest you will note a second cup holder appears and you can also open the center armrest from there or you can pull the armrest forward it becomes more of a usable armrest and you can also open it from there so it's kind of a clever trick to hide a second cup holder in case you don't need it under that center armrest lid and speaking of hiding stuff nissan told me there is a 12 volt outlet in this car but not where you'd expect in the center stack you have usb-a and usb-c no 12-volt to be found instead that's in the passenger footwell so you can plug in a radar detector down there and then run the cord up to the side of the windshield on the passenger side so it won't get in the driver's way nissan told me they put it there intentionally for that purpose as evidence that they know their customers well and as more evidence of this nissan also told me that the traction control off button is here to the left of the steering wheel and very prominent so you can turn off traction control and in the same breath while telling me that they know their customers well and so they have this button so prominent they also reminded me that they don't have an electronic parking brake there's still a manual pull it yourself parking brake and they mention that at the same time as the traction control button which really does show how well nissan knows their customers now couple of other things to point out in this interior one the three gauges at the top of the dashboard this is sort of a heritage thing for nissan other z models have had it and this one does too and this time the gauges are kind of interesting on the left you have a turbo boost gauge since this car is turbocharged in the center you have a turbo speed gauge which actually shows you the speed at which the turbine and then the turbocharger is rotating and that is a pretty cool idea you don't see that in other cars and it's neat to have unfortunately the third gauge is kind of a cop out it's the battery volt meter which i think is kind of hilarious you got your sport gauges that show you the turbo stuff and also your battery voltage nothing too performancy about that but they wanted to have three actual useful gauges up here and so they do also worth noting talking about this interior it's important to point out that a blue one is available i don't mean a blue z which this is i mean a blue interior and i don't mean dark blue i mean bright blue interior is offered if you want to as you can see it really is bright and blue and bright blue and you could have that if you choose obviously this interior is more restrained with sort of the standard black but blue is offered along with a couple of other more traditional colors now since i'm in this interior it's worth pointing out some of the other items that the z performance model adds that the base z sport model doesn't get in this interior one is that rev matching feature i showed you before you can get a z sport with a manual transmission but rev-matching is not offered on that base model only in the performance and by the way if you choose an automatic performance model then instead of rev-matching your transmission upgrade is revise shift paddles which are inspired by the ones in the nissan gtr the performance gets like more exciting gtrs shift pedals than what you get in the base model next up another big upgrade in this interior for the performance compared to the standard sport is the seats the performance has leather seats as you can see here and heated seats which aren't in the base model and you get power seats if you get the performance these seats are power move back and forward the sport model still has manually operated seats so some big seat upgrades in here another big upgrade for the performance is the center infotainment screen nine inch screen in the performance as opposed to an eight inch screen in the base sport model and it's worth pointing out the performance even has some more features in the infotainment screen including a navigation system the sport doesn't offer nav but that is included in the performance although most drivers won't find it really all that important anyway since all z's come standard with apple carplay and android auto but if you want a built-in navigation system you gotta get the performance and one other performance benefit is the sound system this has a bose sound system which is an upgrade over the performance model's standard unbranded sound system so your music will sound nicer if you choose the performance now it is worth pointing out that technically when this car launches it will offer a third trim level which is called the z proto and that's intended to commemorate the original prototype version of this car which came out a few years ago the z proto but that version is limited to 240 units all of which have already sold out so it's not really available but just in case you're curious about it it starts around 53 000 before shipping so like 54 with destination and it includes some cool cosmetic upgrades compared to a performance model for instance you get bronze wheels if you get the proto and you get yellow brake calipers which are kind of cool the proto also has a lot of different yellow accents in the interior like yellow stitching a yellow trim shift knob yellow trim seats that sort of thing and the proto models will have a special plaque identifying them as one of the 240 units of the z proto but aside from that version which is already sold out you basically only have the sport at 40 grand and the performance at 50. and since i'm talking about pricing let's talk supra which is obviously the thing that everybody is going to compare this car against and i gotta say on paper at least it presents a pretty compelling alternative i say that because like i mentioned the new z starts at 40 grand before a destination so you figure maybe about 41 41.5 with shipping well the supra starts at 44 with shipping and that's for the base four cylinder model which only has 260 horsepower the z comes standard with this 400 horse twin turbo v6 for less money than a base supra which is pretty impressive now if you upgrade to the z performance starts around fifty thousand dollars like i said figure 5152 is shipping well the six cylinder supra model starts around 53 000 with shipping so even then the z performance undercuts the six cylinder supra and z has more power once again 400 horses in the z compared to 380 in the supra now the supra is definitely nicer inside i was just in the supra last week and because of its bmw tie-in it has a nicer interior no question about it certainly has better tech and better materials so the z performance and the super are going to be pretty close competitors some will choose the z save a little money get a little power but you could see people choosing the supra instead to go for the nicer interior and not sacrifice too much for power or price however you got to assume that the base model z has just killed the base model supra why would anyone spend more for a supra get forced into an automatic transmission and lose 140 horsepower over this car i strongly suspect it's just not going to happen so bye bye four cylinder supra the new z is here but all of this of course is conjecture based on numbers and pricing and power figures on paper the real question of course is how does it drive this compared to the supra and overall so with that in mind those were the crux and features of the new nissan z now it's time to get it out on the road and see how it drives all right driving the new z i have been very excited about this ever since they showed the prototype which was a while ago i don't remember maybe a year and a half two years uh and here we are driving the newsie this thing is long awaited and on paper it seems so desirable i was just in a new supra um also an amazing car but it has some drawbacks especially when it came out it was automatic only 330 horsepower this car seems and frankly it looks a little weird whether or not you like it it certainly splits opinions this car seems to solve all those problems got more power it's got a manual transmission and it looks really nice i haven't really heard any complaints about the new z's styling except for that front grille which they have kind of made look a little bit more normal by adding the little gray rectangles to it so let's talk about how this card drives there are a few benefits and a few drawbacks which i've noticed let's start with those benefits one is the power this car feels legitimately seriously quick it is a great powertrain and i see this as someone who actually really liked the old powertrain in the old car didn't like the old car all that much uh for other reasons primarily because it was so outdated but i really did like that old v6 it was simple it it made sense there was no forced induction that messed up the revving and made it like spotty it just was an easy and good powertrain and this car is even better this twin turbo v6 is fantastic you get power at the low end you get power at the high end it's a good engine in the q60 and the q50 red sport but it feels like it belongs in this car for some reason it really feels great it's fast it's exciting and it really is fast and exciting at all rpms as long as you're in the right gear downshift to second here and take off oh this car is just playing fast nissan says they don't quote a 0-60 time they leave that for the journalists but i can tell you from a butt dyno perspective this feels faster than the supra and then there's the handling this car is very impressive it is very quick to go around corners it steals steers well very predictable steering reasonably light not incredibly like heavy which i kind of prefer a heavier steering but the steering is good it's precise and more importantly the car handles well it really corners quite well it is flat it feels fantastic in corners very predictable and it feels small in corners this car is five inches longer than the outgoing car nissan told me but it feels small it feels tight and it feels very tossable and you get that feeling whenever you're steering and handling the car and kind of pushing it so where are the drawbacks with this car there are two of them that i can tell that are pretty clear to me from driving the car number one is unquestionably the sound the sound has been a characteristic benefit of these nissan z cars since 2003 with that big 3.5 liter engine that just sounded cool they tuned the exhaust to make it sound exciting well this car's lost that and actually the sound not only is it not great but i don't even think it's all that good it doesn't even sound like a performance car when you wring it out it sounds like you're revving up like a guy flooring it in a v6 camry because he's mad in traffic you know that's kind of what it sounds like in this car and it's disappointing uh this car will definitely be right for tuners to put exhausts on i have absolutely no doubt most people are going to go that direction and i think that's the right move unfortunately the other drawback for this car is the manual transmission gear shift action situation it's good but it's not great nissan told me that they increased the weight of the shift knob by about 25 to make it heavier which contributes to like a better feel when you're changing gears but to me it's still too light it's also too rubbery too notchy just a little bit too vague going through the gears i'm not a big fan of that but that's not the biggest problem the biggest problem is the clutch which feels very notchy very springy i don't like a springy clutch i don't like one that's really pushing back against you especially pushing back for part of the travel and then not as much for the remainder of the travel it's just not really an ideal clutch pedal travel situation i will say i've been driving this car around now for a couple of hours and i've gotten really used to the collection shift direction and it's it's not like bad and it's not problematic when i first got in the car i was a little disappointed but over time i've gotten used to it however it still isn't great it's not as good as some rivals are and it's not as good as it could be now of course i benchmark brands like porsche and that sort of thing and you're not gonna quite get there on a nissan but it would be nice to do a little bit better than this um just a slightly better more weighted gear lever with feels a little bit tighter and a less springy clutch that kind of pushes back on your foot but those are really my only complaints and they're kind of less important things to the main stuff which is this car is fast and it handles well that's what people are looking for sports cars i also happen to like how this car looks the technology is fine it's okay the interior materials are fine they're okay a lot of stuff borrowed from the old car but whatever this car is still fast it's still fun and most importantly it's kind of a bargain and i'm very curious to drive the manual supra and see how that compares to this but this car has some real benefits over that more power lower price and frankly i think it looks better um starting off with a real z advantage there over the supra and so that's the new 2023 nissan z this car has some great benefits there's a lot to like here including attractive styling some nice new technology a good driving experience and that manual transmission and i think this car is pretty clearly one of the more desirable relatively affordable sports cars on the market and now it's time to give the new z a doug score and the doug score is here 62 out of 100 which ties the z with the latest six cylinder toyota supra automatic there's a lot to like about the z if you're an enthusiast it handles well it's really fast it looks great and in those areas the z easily beats out serious competition like the supra the bmw m240i and others the z's weak points are in the daily categories where technology and quality are fine but not impressive and of course practicality suffers since it's a two-seater without huge cargo room but if you want a great new sports car at a reasonable price the z delivers surprisingly well [Music]"
